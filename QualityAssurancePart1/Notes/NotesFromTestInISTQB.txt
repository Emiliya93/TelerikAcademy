QA Notes from test in ISTQB
* A test case tests a test condition (can be verified by one or more test cases)

* Test case specification specifies the inputs and outputs

* A developer makes a mistake which causes a defect that may be seen as
a failure during dynamic testing

* The level of decision coverage is detemined by taking the number of decision outcomes you have tested and dividing that by the total number of decision outcomes in the module
