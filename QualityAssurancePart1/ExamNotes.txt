* Web Driver
- XPath - use relative(some secure element and go in previuos elements to find the needed)

- Use class with the exact info you need

- When using navigation, wait for some element you know its gonna pop out, to be sure that the page is ready for screenshot

- Extract methods in some shared place(for example method TakeScreenshot in class BaseTest)

- Add extension - addblock

- Maximize page

- Dont navigate to the needed page with many clicks, whenm you need to test the *exact* page

- On the end of the test dispose the driver

- to the method TakeScreenshot in the path set the extension
